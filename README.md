# CeasarCipher
This Python project implements a simple Caesar cipher for text encryption and decryption. 
The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique where a fixed number of positions in the alphabet shifts each letter in the plaintext. In this implementation, the shift is three positions.

Features:
1) Encryption:  Shifts each user input letter by three positions to create an encrypted message.
2) Decryption: Shifts each letter reversed of the user's input back by 3 to return the original message.
3) Menu: Exits the program.
